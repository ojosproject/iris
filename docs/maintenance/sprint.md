Our Workflow
------------

We use the Scrum collaboration framework. Since we are students, our sprints are
designed to accommodate the quarter system used by the University of California,
Irvine. This is the schedule for a typical quarter:

- Week 1: Introduction Week
- Week 2-4: First Sprint
- Week 5-7: Second Sprint
- Week 8-10: Third Sprint

We are sometimes active outside academic quarters, though it's entirely
voluntary. It must be indicated in the sprint details.
