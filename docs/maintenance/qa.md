# Quality Assurance

As we get closer to the CHI Competition, the Iris developers are going to start
focusing on Quality Assurance. We will focus on **bug fixing** and improving the
**user experience**.

## Interviews

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure you've compiled the program for testing. **Do not use a developer
> environment.** You can build the program with `npm run build`.

Throughout our UCI academic careers, Ojos Project's developers have learned how
to interview individuals for app-testing purposes. We will do something similar,
except for now it will be with the Ojos Project engineers.

The biggest benefit towards interviewing the Engineering team is because they
are not coding the program. It provides a fresh perspective. Interviews with
the Engineering team will happen either on Monday during the General meeting, or
on Friday during the Engineering meeting.

Here's some things to know before conducting an interview:

1. **Define tasks.** What do you want your testers to do? Make a few tasks that
   you want tested.
2. **Record the screen.** Sometimes, interviewees will do something you did not
   catch. For reporting purposes, it's a good idea to record the screen to
   capture *how* they use Iris. I recommend [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).
3. **Observe without intervening.** Provide tasks, but do not give them tips
   about how to use the system. If they do, it's already a sign of bad UX.
4. **Think out loud.** Ask interviewees to think out loud. (i.e.: "I'm clicking
   this button because I want to do X.")
5. **Ask follow-up questions.** Examples: "What were you expecting to happen?",
   "Was anything unclear or unexpected?", "Did anything work better than
   expected?"
6. **Take notes.** Note down their steps, what they expectations, what actually
   happened, the severity, etc. These notes are *critical* and the entire point
   of these interviews.
7. **Report bugs.** Create bug reports and report them to the Iris issue tracker
   on GitHub.

## Developer tasks

At the beginning of meetings, Carlos will compile a list of bugs and assign them
to the individuals assigned to the
[iris#43](https://github.com/ojosproject/iris/issues/43) issue. These developers
will decide whether to work on it during the meeting, **which is encouraged**,
or to do it on their free time.

The list will be made available on the [sprint document](./sprint.md).
