# Iris Branding Guide

![Brand Guide sample for Iris](../assets/design_sample.jpg)

This document exists to establish a branding guide for the Iris project. Please
read this document to its fullest and make sure you know where you can find
pre-made components for your frontend.

Original guide was created by [@jessed7](https://github.com/jessed7).

## Colors

We're going for a blue/white color scheme as this is
[common in healthcare and conveys trust](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/medical-logo-colors),
and it goes with the
[UCI color scheme](https://brand.uci.edu/master-branding/color-palette/). The
aim for text contrast is to at least WCAG AA criteria.

[supporting several languages](https://typogram.co/font-discovery/how-to-use-noto-sans-font).
