# Accessibility in the Iris Software

Accessibility features are to be implemented by
[Helen Chau](https://github.com/bbobateaa/).

Accessibility is a crucial aspect of modern software development, and even more
so when our tool is in the healthcare space.

## Our Priorities

- **Keyboard shortcuts.** Although Iris is meant to be a touch-first
  application, supporting keyboard shortcuts can be extremely helpful for
  individuals who want to use Iris on a traditional computer.
- **Text to speech.**
- **Internationalization.** Although just a start, we want to implement
  support for various languages.
- **Text size.** We want to provide font sizing options for people who may need
  bigger text.
