# Defining a "core" feature

Iris has two "core" folders in the repository. One of them is in
[`/src-tauri/src/core/`](../src-tauri/src/core/) for backend core features and
another one is in [`/src/app/core/`](../src/app/core/) for core frontend
features.

## What is considered a "core" feature?

A "core" feature can be defined as a feature that is not bound to a single page.
That is, it either does not require a page or its data is used throughout the
program.
