# Animations in the Iris Software

Animations are to be implemented by [Helen Chau](https://github.com/bbobateaa/).

Animation in software has become a common thing to implement, and in my eyes,
are seen as "polished". It makes the system seem more respondent rather than
just being slapped onto the screen. By implementing animation, it makes Iris
look more polished.

## Where to implement animations

- **Dialogs.** When a dialog is opened, it's just thrown onto the screen.
  Instead, the dialog should fade in.
- **Slide-up animation on tool icons.** When a user hovers over a tool icon, it
  should slightly slide-up, making it look like it's hopping.
- **Resources fade-in/fade-out.** When switching between the filters, it might
  be a good idea to fade-in/fade-out the resources.
