# Reporting Security Issues

One of the many benefits of open source software is that security
vulnerabilities can be caught faster with more eyes on the software. However,
reporting a security vulnerability publicly might not be the best solution.

If you want to report a security issue to the Ojos Project Developers team,
[please email Carlos Valdez via cvaldezh@uci.edu](mailto:cvaldezh@uci.edu) and
he will promptly bring it up to the Developers.

## Making an effective report

To ensure we get the most out of your initial report, please:

- Prepend `IRIS SECURITY REPORT:` to the subject line
- Provide a background of the vulnerability, if possible
- Write a detailed explanation of the vulnerability
- Include resources, articles, or anything that may help us fix this faster

## What happens next?

We get to work!

We may also email you back asking for more information and/or help as we patch
the issue.

Once the issue is patched, we will make an announcement. We will also
acknowledge your involvement in the process if you so wish.
